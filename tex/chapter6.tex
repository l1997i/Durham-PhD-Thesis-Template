\chapter{Conclusions}
It was shown using a Faedo Galerkin approximation that there exist a unique solution for  the coupled pair of Cahn-Hilliard equations
modelling  a phase separation on a thin
film of binary liquid mixture coating substrate, which is wet by one
component.  This solution satisfies certain stability
bounds. The regularity result was driven at the end of Chapter 2 as having
major contribution in obtaining the error bound for the method proposed.
