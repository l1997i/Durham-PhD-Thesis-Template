abstract = {This paper jointly optimizes the precoding matrices and the set of active remote radio heads (RRHs) to minimize the network power consumption for a user-centric cloud radio access network, where both the RRHs and users have multiple antennas and each user is served by its nearby RRHs. Both users' rate requirements and per-RRH power constraints are considered. Due to these conflicting constraints, this optimization problem may be infeasible. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem in two stages. In Stage I, a low-complexity user selection algorithm is proposed to find the largest subset of feasible users. In Stage II, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem with the users selected from Stage I. Specifically, the re-weighted l1-norm minimization method is used to transform the original problem with non-smooth objective function into a series of weighted power minimization (WPM) problems, each of which can be solved by the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method. The solution obtained by the WMMSE method is proved to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the WPM problem. Moreover, a low-complexity algorithm based on Newton's method and the gradient descent method is developed to update the precoder matrices in each iteration of the WMMSE method. Simulation results demonstrate the rapid convergence of the proposed algorithms and the benefits of equipping multiple antennas at the user side. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in terms of NPC.},

abstract = {This paper studies the impact of hardware mismatch (HM) between the base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE) in the downlink (DL) of large-scale antenna systems. Analytical expressions to predict the achievable rates are derived for different precoding methods, i.e., matched filter (MF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF), using large system analysis techniques. Furthermore, the upper bounds on achievable rates of MF and RZF with HM are investigated, which are related to the statistics of the circuit gains of the mismatched hardware. Moreover, we present a study of HM calibration, where we take zero-forcing (ZF) precoding as an example to compare two HM calibration schemes, i.e., Pre-precoding Calibration (Pre-Cal) and Post-precoding Calibration (Post-Cal). The analysis shows that Pre-Cal outperforms Post-Cal schemes. Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out, and numerical results demonstrate the correctness of the analysis.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is an emerging technology that aims for efficient spectrum usage by allowing unlicensed (secondary) users to access licensed frequency bands under the condition of protecting the licensed (primary) users from harmful interference. The latter condition constraints the achievable throughput of a cognitive radio network, which should therefore access a wideband spectrum in order to provide reliable and efficient services to its users. In this paper, we study the problem of designing the optimal sensing time and power allocation strategy, in order to maximize the ergodic throughput of a cognitive radio that employs simultaneous multiband detection and operates under two different schemes, namely the wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing (WSSS) and the wideband opportunistic spectrum access (WOSA) scheme. We consider average transmit and interference power constraints for both schemes, in order to effectively protect the primary users from harmful interference, propose two algorithms that acquire the optimal sensing time and power allocation under imperfect spectrum sensing for the two schemes and discuss the effect of the average transmit and interference power constraint on the optimal sensing time. Finally, we provide simulation results to compare the two schemes and validate our theoretical analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

@article{Muralidharan2012,
abstract = {We consider the wireless two-way relay channel, in which two-way data transfer takes place between the end nodes with the help of a relay. For the Denoise-And-Forward (DNF) protocol, it was shown by Koike-Akino et. al. that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay greatly reduces the impact of Multiple Access interference at the relay. The harmful effect of the deep channel fade conditions can be effectively mitigated by a proper choice of these network coding maps at the relay. Alternatively, in this paper we propose a Distributed Space Time Coding (DSTC) scheme, which effectively removes most of the deep fade channel conditions at the transmitting nodes itself without any CSIT and without any need to adaptively change the network coding map used at the relay. It is shown that the deep fades occur when the channel fade coefficient vector falls in a finite number of vector subspaces of 2, which are referred to as the singular fade subspaces. DSTC design criterion referred to as the singularity minimization criterion under which the number of such vector subspaces are minimized is obtained. Also, a criterion to maximize the coding gain of the DSTC is obtained. Explicit low decoding complexity DSTC designs which satisfy the singularity minimization criterion and maximize the coding gain for QAM and PSK signal sets are provided. Simulation results show that at high Signal to Noise Ratio, the DSTC scheme provides large gains when compared to the conventional Exclusive-OR network code and performs slightly better than the adaptive network coding scheme proposed by Koike-Akino et. al. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A cognitive radio network (CRN) is formed by either allowing the secondary users (SUs) in a secondary communication network (SCN) to opportunistically operate in the frequency bands originally allocated to a primary communication network (PCN) or by allowing SCN to coexist with the primary users (PUs) in PCN as long as the interference caused by SCN to each PU is properly regulated. In this paper, we consider the latter case, known as spectrum sharing, and study the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity of the SU fading channel under different types of power constraints and fading channel models. In particular, besides the interference power constraint at PU, the transmit power constraint of SU is also considered. Since the transmit power and the interference power can be limited either by a peak or an average constraint, various combinations of power constraints are studied. It is shown that there is a capacity gain for SU under the average over the peak transmit/interference power constraint. It is also shown that fading for the channel between SU transmitter and PU receiver is usually a beneficial factor for enhancing the SU channel capacities. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.},

For the purpose of performance comparison we consider three distinct cases; In the first scenario, each relay estimates its backward and forward channels, in the second scenario each relay knows its backward and forward channels perfectly and finally in the third scenario relays have no knowledge of channels.

abstract = {Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) constitute one of the most promising techniques for supporting the 5G mobile system. By deploying more small cells in a fixed area, the average distance between users and access points can be significantly reduced; hence, dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However, severe interference is the major obstacle in UDNs. Most contributions deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This article advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDNs, thanks to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN, centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission. We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with special emphasis on the application of big data techniques.},

In addition, we present the most relevant research efforts made around RPL routing protocol that pertain to its performance evaluation, implementation, experimentation, deployment and improvement. We also present an experimental performance evaluation of RPL for different network settings to understand the impact of the protocol attributes on the network behavior, namely in terms of convergence time, energy, packet loss and packet delay.
